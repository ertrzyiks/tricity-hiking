## Starting point

The beginning of the path is located at the end of Abrahama street in Gdańsk. It's also entrance
to the Samborowo Valley and Zielona (Green) Valley. There a few parking spots available, but since
it's not a popular tourist destination it's not crowded.

The closest you can get here using public transport is by bus 149 or 249 to _Norblina_ stop.
If you don't mind an extra 10 minutes walk you can use a train or tram to _Strzyża PKM_ stop.

## Samborowo Valley

The valley name comes from Sambor I, a governor of Gdańsk Pomerania in the end of 12th century.
At the time that Gdańsk was dominated by German-speaking citizens the valley was called Henrietta Valley
(ger. Henriettental). The walk through the valley is quote short and flat. At the crossroad you
should turn right to climb a hill. The path is not very steep, but steadily takes you up the hill.
Alternatively, you can pick the more challenging climb by continuing straight ahead. You will reach
the final altitude fast and then the path becomes flat.

## Ridge

At the top of the hill where the two mentioned paths meet pick the path that leads north.
It goes through the ridge with two valleys on each side. The one on right is Samborowo which you
just passed, the one on the left is Zielona (Green) Valley. The path is flat and easy to walk.
The view on the valleys is mostly blocked by the trees. Approximately in the middle of the ridge
on your left you will find a path descending to the Zielona Valley. It's pretty steep without
any safety measures, so be careful especially if it's wet.

## Głowica

Once you reach the flat area again it means you are in the Zielona Valley. Soon enough there is
a cross-road. The path to the left is the one you will use to go back. Meanwhile, proceed straight
ahead to climb another hill. It's not Głowica yet, but definitely significant increase in altitude.
Well, at least in the context of the area. After a few left turns you will find yourself on the path
leading to the top of Głowica. It's the highest point of the area but the view is completely
obstructed by trees. The hill was used as a placement for one of the leading light towers of
the Wrzeszcz airport. The airport was moved to the current location in 1974. The tower is no longer
used for the intented purpose but still stands there.

## Zielona Valley

After a short backtracking you will find a path descending to the Zielona Valley. This one is
pretty mild and the path through the valley is flat which means getting back to the starting
point should be very easy.

## Going back

The path is a loop so if you came here by a car you will find yourself back at the parking spot.

For public tranportation you can use the same stops as mentioned in the beginning in the opposite
direction.
