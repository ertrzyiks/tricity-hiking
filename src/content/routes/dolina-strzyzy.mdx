# Starting point

The route starts at the entrance to the _Dolina Strzyży_ (Strzyża Valley). You can get there by card and park
at a free parking lot along the _Potokowa_ street. You can also take a _PKM_ train to from _Gdańsk Wrzeszcz_ to
_Gdańsk Brętowo_ station. You can reach the starting from by walking about 10 minutes from there. The same train
station can be approached by bus _227_. The closest you can get by bus is _Karskiego_ stop of _116_ bus.

# Along the stream

Once you enter the forest you will find yourself walking along the _Strzyża_ stream. The beginning of the trail is
quite flat. Once you reach the crossroad and pick the second right, an uphill path. Eventually you will merge back
to the main trail so look for the first left turn, which will take you to the stream again. Continue straight and
will reach the place where you can cross the stream. The construction that allows to pass on the other side
does not deserve to be called a bridge. It is a few logs that you can walk on. The stream is quite narrow so
you could risk a jump as well.

# Downhill

Continue along the stream for a moment and then climb the hill. On the top of the hill you will find a beginning
of the downhill trail for mountain bikers. It's full of bumps and turns. Watch out for the bikers if you decide to
follow that path or pick one of the parallel trails. Soon enough will you reach quite wide, comfortable path.
Continue straight and prepare to cross the stream again. This time you will be offered a proper bridge.
Soon after the crossing you will reach the crossroad you've seen before. Turn right towards the valley entrance.

# Going back

It's a loop so you will end up at the same entrance to the valley. While you trace your steps back to the car
or the stop enjoy sight of the retention tanks and meanders of the Strzya stream.
