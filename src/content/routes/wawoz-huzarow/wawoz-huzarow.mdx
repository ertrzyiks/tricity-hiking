# Starting point

The route begins at the end of _Niedźwiednik_ street. You can get there by car and park along the road.
You can also take a bus _157_ to _Potokowa_ stop and walk about 10 minutes to the starting point.
You can also take a _PKM_ train to _Gdańsk Niedźwiednik_ station, but from here you will have to
walk about 20 minutes instead.

# To the Gorge

The trail leads through the forest and terrain is unique for the area. The path to the gorge is elevated
as it goes on the side of the _Niedźwiedzia_ valley. At one point you will cross the valley and continue
the path on the other side. Eventually you will reach to bottom of the gorge.
The area around the gorge is a nature reserve. You will be informed about it by a few signs.
In this area it's forbidden to walk outside the marked paths. There are two of them, one on each
side of the gorge. Pick the one on the right side. After a short climb you will reach the top
of the gorge.

# Back to the valley

Once you reach a crossroad, turn left. After a u-turn the path leads quite close to the
_Słowackiego_ street. The noise of the traffic is a bit distracting at this point, but soon enough
you can go back to enjoy the nature. After two sharp left turns you will be on the path that leads
to the _Niedźwiedzia_ valley crossing. This time you will reach it from the other side.
After the crossing turn right and enjoy the new perspective on the path you once passed
on this trail already.

# Going back

It's a loop so either jump in your car or navigate to the closest bus stop or a train station as
described above.
