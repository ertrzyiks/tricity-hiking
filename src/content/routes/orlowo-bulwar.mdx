# Starting point

The path starts at the Orłowo Pier. You can get there by car and park nearby. The parking is paid and can be crowded during the summer season.
Alternatively, you can take a train to Gdynia Orłowo and walk to the pier. It's roughly 20 minutes walk from the train station.

# Klif Orłowski

The first fragment is a sidewalk along the beach. Next, quite steep stairs lead to the path along the cliff.

# Going back

The path ends at the boulevard leading to the center of Gdynia.
