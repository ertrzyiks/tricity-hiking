# Starting point

The route begins at the entrance to the _Dolina Radości_ (Valley of Joy). There is no easy way to get there
by public transport. The quickest option is to take a car and park it at the small parking lot.

Alternatively you can extend your hike by a 40 minutes walk from the closest bus stop _Karwieńska_, but at this point consider planing your trip
from another direction. For example if you start from _Harfowa_ street you can cover this distance through the forest paths rather
than along the road.

# Going up

# And coming down

# Going back

You are likely going back to pick up your car. Otherwise you need another 40 minutes walk to the closest public transport stop.
