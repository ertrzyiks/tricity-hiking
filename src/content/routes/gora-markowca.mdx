# Starting point

The route starts on the parking on the _Młyńska street_ in Rumia. The most convenient way
to get there is by car. Another good options is to take an _SKM_ train to Rumia and walk
about 20 minutes from the station.

# Góra Markowca

The first part of the trail is a steep climb up the stairs with railing. Once you reach the top
of Góra Markowca you can climb a few more steps to the observation deck. The entry is free.
The hill is not very high, but the view is quite nice. It was a natural place for a placement
of an artillery and anti-aircraft battery during Second World War.
The remnants of the fortifications are still visible. Today the place serves as a viewpoint and recreation area.
The sides of the observation platform serve as a climbing wall.

# Through the forest

You can continue the walk through the forest. Go down the hill until you reach a street. Turn left until you
reach a crossroad. Pick a path that goes straight up another hill. The climb is not steep but is a bit longer
than the first one. As you reach the higher point continue straight and you will be rewarded with a few places
where the view is not obstructed by the trees. Once the path merges into the black trail turn left.
This tail leads back to the crossroad. Before you reach it you will walk next to the historical _Auerhahn glade_.
It does not play any significant role today, but you can read about its history on the information board.

# Going back

Once you reach the forest crossroad you can either climb the hill again and come back with the same stairs
to the parking or take the easy walk following the black trail. If you choose to leave Rumia by train you can
skip both options and go back to the station from the crossroad right away.
