# Starting point

The route begins at the entrance to the _Dolina Radości_. There is no easy way to get there
by public transport. The quickest option is to take a car and park it at the small parking lot.

Alternatively you can extend your hike by a 40 minutes walk from the closest bus stop _Karwieńska_, but at this point consider planing your trip
from another direction. For example if you start from _Harfowa_ street you can cover this distance through the forest paths rather
than along the road.

# Going up

Locate the entrance to the valley and start walking along the stream. Soon you will find yourself on the glade limited by two asphalt roads
on both sides. You can expect little to no traffic on this road since the area within the landscape
protection area. If you spot a vehicle here, it's probably the forest service or an ambulance.
Pick the left road and proceed the mild climb. After a couple of tight turns you will reach a crossroad.

# And coming down

The highest point of the trail is behind you. You can take a rest in the forest gazebo or consult the printed map that is available here.
Turn right and after a few minutes leave the asphalt road and continue on the forest path. The path from now on leads gently downhill.
Once you cross the stream turn right. Continue straight and you will reach the glade and the crossroad you have seen before.

# Going back

You are likely going back to pick up your car. Otherwise you can consider another 40 minutes walk to the closest public transport stop.
