## Starting point

The path starts at the Orłowo Pier. You can get there by car and park nearby.
The parking is paid and can be crowded during the summer season.
Alternatively, you can take a train to _Gdynia Orłowo_ and walk to the pier.
It's roughly 20 minutes walk from the _Gdynia Orłowo_ train station.

## Klif Orłowski

The first fragment is a sidewalk along the beach. Next, quite steep stairs lead to the path along the cliff.
The path is located at safe distance from the edge. It's a good thing, but also means the view on the sea
is obstructed by the trees. There are several viewpoints along the way though.

## Artillery battery

After a few houndred meters, the path leads deeper into the forrest and then almost reaching the residential area.
There is a bug stop which allows to reach _Gdynia Redłowo_ train stop in case you plan to cut it short.
Otherwise, the path leads back towards the sea. It's not a way straight down though. First, there is a short climb.
Then, you will have a chance to visit the remnants of a permament coastal defence battery. The artillery
was built after the Second World War. After it lost its military value it was left intact and availble for visitors.
In the beginning of the 21st century it was partially renovated and military enthusiasts may slow down the pace
significantly in this area as there is plenty to see.

## Going back

From there, the path leads back to the sea level. After a short walk on the sand beach you will reach the boulevard.
The closest train station from there is _Gdynia Wzgórze Św. Maksymiliana_. However, you can continue your walk as the boulevard
leads to the center of Gdynia. Either way the proximity of the restaurants and cafes is guaranteed.
