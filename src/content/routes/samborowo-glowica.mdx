# Starting point

The begging of the path is located at the end of Abrahama street in Gdańsk. It's also entrance
to the Samborowo Valley and Zielona (Green) Valley. There a few parking spots available, but since
it's not a popular turist destination it's not crowded.

The closest you can get here using public transport is by bus 149 or 249 to _Norblina_ stop.
If you don't mind an extra 10 minutes walk you can use a train or tram to _Strzyża PKM_ stop.
