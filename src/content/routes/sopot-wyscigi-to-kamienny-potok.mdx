# Starting point

The path starts at the _Sopot Wyścigi_ train station. The most convenient way to get there
is by SKM train and that's how the route is designed. If you're coming by car, you can park
next to the station at the end of the _Polna_ street.

# Hippodrome

When you leave the train station go across the street and take stairs down to the _Polna_ street.
If you look at your right you'll see the _Sopot Hippodrome_. It's a place with long history, hosting
many events like races and shows.

# South Park

Go straight and you will see a roundaround. Continue straight and once you pass _Berka Joselewicza_ street
turn left into a sidewalk. This car-free passage will lead you the _3 Maja_ street. Turn right and
continue straight until you reach _Grunwaldzka_ street. Go across the street and you will end up
on the _Parkowa_ street. It's a narrow, beautiful street going along the beach. It's a great way to reach
the center of Sopot avoiding the crowded promenade. The end of the street meets the South Park. It's a small
park with a playground and a salt fountain. Continuing straight you will pass the
church of the Evangelical-Augsburg parish dedicated to the Savior. Right after the church there is a building of
Balneological Institute in Sopot, you can recognize it by the overpass connecting two parts of the building.
History of both places starts in the first years of the 20th century.

# Pier

The path continues to the North Park but before you reach it you have an opportunity to visit the most popular place
in Sopot. The Sopot pier is the longest wooden pier in Europe. You can take a pause here and enjoy the view of the Baltic Sea.
Once you are on the pier look at your right to see the facilities of the New Heaven's Port of Gdańsk. The view on the left
is dominated by the Gdynia Orłowo and it's cliff. A bit further you will see "Sea Towers", a prominent skyscraper complex
located near the waterfront in Gdynia.

# North Park

Once you feel you have enough of the pier, go back to the path along the beach. After a few minutes you will be walking through
the alleys of the North Park. There is another playground, a few restaurants and coffee shops. Shortly after the park
becomes much less crowded and you will be walking through the forest. The path is flat and easy to walk. You will still pass a few
restaurants, but the proximity of the nature reserve will be very visible. The terrain becomes muddy and sidewalk changes into a wooden
platform. Continue until you encounter the natural boundary between Sopot and Gdynia - Swelina stream. You can be sure that you
are in the good place if you see the bower and the path splits into two options: stairs going up and entrance to the beach.
Turn back and head back towards the center of Sopot, but this time take the path farther from the beach. On your right side
you will see stone stairs. While you climb them you can take a sneak peak at Sopot Amphitheater, next to the aquapark.
Continue straight and after crossing the _Aleja Zwycięstwa_ you will reach the _Sopot Kamienny Potok_ train station.

# Going back

The easiest way to go back is to take a _SKM_ train from the _Sopot Kamienny Potok_ station to your next destination
or to _Sopot Wyścigi_ station where you started your journey in case you parked your car there.
