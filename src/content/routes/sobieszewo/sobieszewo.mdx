The northern part of the Sobieszewo island is covered by forest with two nature reserves on east and west sides: the _Ptasi Raj_ (Bird's Paradise) and the _Mewia Łacha_.
The island is inhabited but population is sparse,
so you can enjoy the tranquility of nature, fruity smell of the berries and the sounds of birds chirping.
This route takes you through the central part of the island, but if you feel like exploring more, it's worth
extending your trip to the nature reserves mentioned above.

## Starting point

Sobieszewo Island is within the boundaries of Gdańsk city and is accessible by public transport.
There are several bus lines connecting Sobieszewo with the city center of Gdańsk, including 112, 186.
The line that takes you closest to the starting point of the route is bus line 112, which stops at _Gdańsk Lazurowa_ stop
and departs roughly every 40 minutes.

> **Note:** Bus frequencies may vary between summer and winter seasons. Please verify current schedules at [ZTM Gdańsk](https://www.ztm.gda.pl/) before your trip.

You can also reach Sobieszewo by car. There are parking lots available near the starting point of the route. The place is a popular
destination for beachgoers during the summer, so parking spaces may be limited.

If you are up for a challenge you can also reach Sobieszewo by bike. There are bike paths leading to the island from Gdańsk city center.

Consider checking the lifting bridge schedule in advance. That's the only bridge connecting the island to the mainland and it can be closed
for boat traffic at certain times.

## Kazimierz Reservoir

The route begins at the _Zbiornik Kazimierz_ (Kazimierz Reservoir). In the summer months [you can book a tour](https://szlak.gda.pl/en/kazimierz-reservoir/)
and visit the reservoir. Note that there is no ticket selling point on-site, so be sure to use the website.
The terrace offers a beautiful view of the water and surrounding nature.

## Loop

From the reservoir head east towards the _Góra Orła_ (Eagle mountain). It's the highest point on the island and the highest dune in Gdańsk.
The view from the top is obstructed by trees, but you can still enjoy the greenery of the island. From there, continue east on the path but
don't feel obliged to stick to the main trail. There are several smaller paths leading through the forest that you can explore.

Once you start heading west don't hesitate to take a detour and visit the beach. The area is more pristine compared to the beaches
between Gdańsk and Sopot. It's good if you need a calm break away from the crowds, but it also means there are no facilities available.

On your way back you can pick between a couple of parallel paths. The most interesting one goes on top of the embankment.
It offers a nice elevated view on the surroundings and is cut through by several passages making it an intriguing walk.
You can recognize the spot to turn south by a couple of stalls selling snacks and drinks during the summer season.
The narrow forest road will lead you back to the starting point.
