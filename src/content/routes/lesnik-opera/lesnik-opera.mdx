## Starting point

The path starts at the forest parking next to the Leśnik sanatorium. You can get there by car
and stop directly at the parking, free of charge. This option will force you to either walk the route
back doubling the distance or to take a bus back to the starting point.

Alternatively, you can jump into bus 117 from _Sopot Sikorskiego_ which goes straight to the _Sopot Sanatorium "Leśnik"_.

## Wielka Gwiazda

After a short uphill walk the path becomes flat and leads to the first interesting place.
The Wielka Gwiazda (eng. Great Star, ger: Großer Stern) is a crossing of several trails in the forest.
The name comes from the [restaurant that used to be there before Second World War][wielka-gwiazda]. The restaurant was
burned down, only a few fragments of the foundations remain.

Nowadays it's a great place to rest and have a snack in one of the wooden bowers.

## Mała Gwiazda

Shortly after the Wielka Gwiazda you will reach the Mała Gwiazda. It's also a crossing of several trails.
One of them, to the right (or south) leads to Zajęcze Wzgórze (eng. Hare Hill) which is a scenic viewpoint and a great place for picnic.
However, the path to the left (or north) is the one you should take to reach the Łysa Góra (eng. Bald mountain).

## Łysa Góra

It's one of the few places in the forest nearby Sopot where the view is not blocked by the trees (hence the hill name).
The panoramic view from the hill allows to see a big part of Sopot and Gdańsk.
In the winter the hill turns into a ski slope, the only one in Tricity.

## Wzniesienie Strzeleckie

From Łysa Góra the path leads through the forest around the Opera Leśna amphitheater. The path first
features the former ski jumping hill with K-point of 25 meters. It's unused since the Second World War, but the
take-off point is still visible. A few minutes of walk later we face a choice - to climb a steep hill forward or walk around it to the left.
Both paths leads to the same place - the Wzniesienie Strzeleckie (eng. Shooter's Hill). It's a viewpoint with a nice view on Sopot.

## Going back

Depending on the desired distance the path can end here. Continue the path to the same direction downhill to reach urban area of Sopot
and eventually the main street / train station. Alternatively, turn around and walk back to the starting point.
