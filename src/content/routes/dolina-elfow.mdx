# Starting point

The route stats at the _Gdańsk Przymorze-Uniwersytet_ train station. You can get there by _SKM_ train.
This is also a business center area so you can get there by car and park it in one of the parking lots.
All of them are paid though.

# Olivia

One thing that catches the eye is the _Olivia Star_, the highest building in Gdańsk. If you fancy a nice panoramic
view on Tricity, the 32nd floor is available for visitors after you buy a ticket. The route goes
along of the _Olivia Business Centre_ parkings and continues in proximity of another Olivia.
The _Olivia hall_ is an ice rink where you can watch hockey games or go ice skating (in the winter).
On the other side of the street there is a _Gdańsk University of Technology_ campus. One of the buildings
that ask for attention is the build of a library. The facade is decorated with three interesting elements that
stick out. From the ground level they look a bit like bullets but are in fact bookmarks.

# Polanki street

Moving forward you will cross the _Wita Stwosza_ street and eventually reach the _Polanki_ street.
In the historical Gdańsk, this was the main road that connected Gdańsk with _Oliwa_.
Alongside the road rich families built they summer residences. In total there were eight of them.
They had different owners throughout the years. To this day only five of them are still standing.

The first one that you pass is the _Court III_, which is currently a correctional facility.
Soon after you will see the buildings of the _Court II_ where Bridgettine Nuns run
the International Ecumenical Center.

# Going back

From _Gdańsk Oliwa_ you can take an _SKM_ train to your next destination or go back to the starting point
to pick up your car.
