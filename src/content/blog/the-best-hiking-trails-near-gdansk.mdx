Visiting Gdańsk is worthwhile for many reasons. The city's rich history,
inspiring architecture, and beachfront location attract many tourists each year.

which offers a variety of hiking trails suitable for all levels of experience.
Although the area is not mountainous, the terrain shaped by glacial activity creates
interesting hills and valleys, making for enjoyable hikes.
