Visiting Gdańsk is worthwhile for many reasons. The city's rich history,
inspiring architecture, and beachfront location attract many tourists each year.
What is less known is that the city is build around the Tricity Landscape Park,
which offers a variety of hiking trails suitable for all levels of experience.
Although the area is not mountainous, the terrain shaped by glacial activity creates
interesting hills and valleys, making for enjoyable hikes.

## Best Time to Visit

The best time to explore hiking trails near Gdańsk is during the spring, summer,
and early autumn months. Regardless of the season you can enjoy a calm hiking.
The trails are accessible year-round, but the vast area to explore and rather light
traffic on the trails makes for a pleasant experience with no crowds.

- March-May: Mild weather, blooming nature
- June-August: Long days, warm weather
- September-November: Beautiful fall colors, rather mild weather
- December-February: Winter scenery, but shorter days

## Recommended Hiking Spots

### Pachołek Hill

The hill is located in Gdańsk Oliwa, in proximity of the famous Oliwa Cathedral and Oliwa Park.
Both the park and the cathedral are worth a visit on their own, but the hill is a great location for two reasons.
First of all it's a relatively high point in the area, elevated even more by the viewing platform on the top.
You can climb the platform and enjoy a panoramic view on Gdańsk unobstructed by trees.
Secondly, the hill is a great starting point for a hike through the Tricity Landscape Park.

### Valleys along Polanki Street

The main road connecting Gdańsk with Oliwa in the past went through today's Polanki street
which corresponds to the village of Polanki that was located here. Along the street rich
families built their residences - seven in total. What they all had in common is proximity to nature as
all seven courts were built right next to the valleys.

Five of them are still standing and to some extent offer a glimpse into their past glory.
Those that were destroyed still heavily influence the area, the district where the seventh court
was located is called Court VII. Either way the valleys that attracted people for centuries are still there
and you can explore them on foot or bike.
