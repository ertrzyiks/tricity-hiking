# Public Transportation Review - Findings and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the review of public transportation hints in the hiking route MDX files. Due to network restrictions preventing access to external public transportation websites (ZTM Gdańsk, Jakdojade, Google Maps), I was unable to verify current bus lines, stop names, and frequencies against official sources. However, I have:

1. Created a comprehensive review guide for manual verification
2. Added helpful notes to routes with public transportation information
3. Identified areas requiring verification
4. Provided recommendations for improving public transportation documentation

## Changes Made

### 1. Created TRANSPORTATION_REVIEW.md

A comprehensive guide that documents:
- All public transportation references found in route files
- Specific bus lines that need verification (117, 157, 112, 186, 227, 116, 149, 249)
- Train stations (SKM and PKM networks)
- Stop names
- Frequency information
- Checklist for verification

### 2. Added Verification Notes to Route Files

Added helpful notes to the following routes directing users to verify current schedules:

- **sobieszewo.mdx**: Added note about seasonal variations in bus 112 frequency
- **lesnik-opera.mdx**: Added note to verify bus 117 schedule
- **wawoz-huzarow.mdx**: Added note to verify bus 157 and PKM train schedules
- **dolina-strzyzy.mdx**: Added note to verify bus 227, bus 116, and PKM train schedules
- **samborowo-glowica.mdx**: Added note to verify bus 149/249 schedules

## Public Transportation References Inventory

### Bus Lines Referenced
- **117**: Sopot Sikorskiego → Sopot Sanatorium "Leśnik"
- **157**: To Potokowa stop
- **112**: To Sobieszewo/Gdańsk Lazurowa (frequency: "roughly every 40 minutes")
- **186**: To Sobieszewo
- **227**: To Gdańsk Brętowo station
- **116**: To Karskiego stop
- **149**: To Norblina stop
- **249**: To Norblina stop

### Train Stations Referenced

**SKM (Fast Urban Railway) Stations:**
- Gdańsk Przymorze-Uniwersytet
- Gdańsk Oliwa
- Sopot Wyścigi
- Sopot Kamienny Potok
- Rumia

**PKM (Pomeranian Metropolitan Railway) Stations:**
- Gdańsk Niedźwiednik
- Gdańsk Wrzeszcz
- Gdańsk Brętowo
- Strzyża PKM

**Other Train Stations:**
- Gdynia Orłowo
- Gdynia Redłowo
- Gdynia Wzgórze Św. Maksymiliana

## Issues Identified

### Missing Information
1. **Tram line not specified** in samborowo-glowica.mdx - mentions "train or tram to Strzyża PKM" but doesn't specify which tram line
2. **Bus line not specified** near artillery battery in orlowo-bulwar.mdx
3. **Bus line not specified** serving Karwieńska stop in dolina-radosci.mdx

### Information That May Be Outdated
1. **Bus 112 frequency**: "roughly every 40 minutes" - may have changed or varies seasonally
2. **Bus line consolidation**: Lines 149 and 249 to Norblina - these might have been consolidated
3. **Stop names**: May have changed with new infrastructure developments

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Immediate Actions)
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Add notes to routes directing users to verify current schedules
2. **TODO**: Repository owner should verify all bus lines and stop names using:
   - Official ZTM Gdańsk website: https://www.ztm.gda.pl/
   - Route planner: https://jakdojade.pl/gdansk/
   - Google Maps public transit directions

### Medium-term (Next Updates)
1. Add specific tram line number in samborowo-glowica.mdx
2. Add specific bus line number near artillery battery in orlowo-bulwar.mdx
3. Add specific bus line serving Karwieńska stop in dolina-radosci.mdx
4. Update bus 112 frequency with current information
5. Verify if buses 149 and 249 still operate separately or have been consolidated

### Long-term (Continuous Improvement)
1. **Add metadata**: Include "lastVerified: YYYY-MM-DD" field in route frontmatter
2. **Link to live schedules**: Add links to real-time departure information where available
3. **Seasonal variations**: Note if bus frequencies differ between summer and winter
4. **Accessibility info**: Add accessibility information for stations and stops
5. **Alternative routes**: Consider adding backup options if primary route is temporarily unavailable
6. **Standard format**: Create a consistent template for public transportation sections

### Proposed Standard Format

Consider standardizing the transportation section format across all routes:

```markdown
## Getting There

**Last verified:** YYYY-MM-DD

### By Train
- **Line**: SKM/PKM
- **Station**: Station Name
- **Walking time**: X minutes to trailhead
- **Schedule**: [View live departures](link)

### By Bus
- **Line**: XXX
- **Stop**: Stop Name
- **Walking time**: X minutes to trailhead
- **Frequency**: Peak: every X min / Off-peak: every Y min
- **Schedule**: [View route details](link)

### By Car
- Parking location and details
- Parking fees (if applicable)

> **Note:** Public transportation schedules may change. Always verify current routes and times at [ZTM Gdańsk](https://www.ztm.gda.pl/).
```

## Quality Observations

### Strengths
- Consistent formatting across most routes
- Clear separation of transportation modes (bus, train, car)
- Walking times are specified for most routes
- Alternative options provided for accessibility
- Train networks (SKM/PKM) are clearly identified

### Areas for Improvement
- No verification dates for transportation information
- Some missing bus/tram line numbers
- Frequency information limited (only one route has it)
- No links to official schedules or route planners
- No mention of seasonal variations

## Next Steps for Repository Owner

1. **Immediate**: Review TRANSPORTATION_REVIEW.md and verify all listed items
2. **Within 1 month**: Update any outdated information found
3. **Within 3 months**: Add missing line numbers and frequency information
4. **Ongoing**: Establish a quarterly review process for transportation information
5. **Future**: Consider implementing the standard format template

## Conclusion

The current public transportation information in the route files is well-structured and user-friendly. However, without access to verify against current schedules, I cannot confirm accuracy. The comprehensive review guide (TRANSPORTATION_REVIEW.md) provides a clear checklist for the repository owner to verify and update all public transportation information.

The added notes in the MDX files now direct users to verify current schedules, reducing the risk of confusion from potentially outdated information.
